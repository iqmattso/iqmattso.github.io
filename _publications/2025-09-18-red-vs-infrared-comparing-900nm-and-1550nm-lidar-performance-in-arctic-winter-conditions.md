excerpt: 'We present here the results of a data collection campaign involving a 1550 nm and 900 nm lidar operating in
severe winter weather conditions. Data for both lidars was collected simultaneously during arctic-like conditions
where fine snow or ice particles are often suspended in the air severely reducing visibility. In this work we
qualitatively and quantitatively compare the performance of these lidars. Performance is compared with respect
to clutter noise from scattering, object detection in the presence of snow. We find the 1550 nm lidar is more
likely to detect snow, resulting in increased clutter noise.'
